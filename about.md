<p class="lead">QA engineer turned systems thinker using AI agents to pressure-test infrastructure, markets, and travel routines.</p>

## Background

- 3+ years testing authentication and networking at Fortinet across LDAP, Kerberos, and HTTP/2/3 stacks.
- Built automation with Python, Ansible, and CI pipelines to keep complex systems observable.
- Apply reliability instincts to infrastructure, markets, and how I move through cities.

## What I'm iterating on now

### Using agents as research copilots

- Chain AI agents to map energy markets, emerging infra, and the capital powering datacenter growth.
- Capture experiments in code, small bets, and daily routines instead of overfitting to one big project.

### Systems & code

- Leveling up containerization, observability, and end-to-end testing with Docker, Kubernetes, and Playwright.
- Turning QA rigor into tooling that shortens feedback loops for small, distributed teams.

### Travel & inner work

- Designing travel operating systems that protect deep work while staying curious in new cities.
- Tracking how meditation and breathwork influence focus, decision speed, and writing cadence.

## Why I write

To learn in public, connect with other systems thinkers, and build shared maps of how software, capital, and travel reinforce each other.

## Now

- **Location:** Vancouver, BC
- **Active projects:** Digital garden overhaul, automated market memos, and power-grid data sourcing.
- **Practices:** Daily writing sprints, interval training, and Vipassana sits.
