<p class="lead">I'm Jiajun Liang, a QA engineer who thinks in systems. I use reports to document what I learn about software, markets, and slow travel.</p>

## Background

- 3+ years testing engineering and networking at Fortinet across LDAP, Kerberos, and HTTP/2/3.
- Built automation with Python, Ansible, and CI pipelines to keep services observable.
- Carry reliability thinking into how I allocate time, capital, and attention.

## Currently

- Shipping testing infrastructure with AI copilots to surface signals quickly.
- Tuning experiments in trading strategies, writing cadence, and mental models.
- Writing notes in English and Chinese to make sense of systems versus what just sounds good.

## Why I write

I share working notes to learn in public, meet fellow systems thinkers, and stay honest about what the data shows.
