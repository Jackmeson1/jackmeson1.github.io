<p class="lead">I'm Jiajun Liang, a QA engineer who thinks in systems. I use AI agents to connect what I learn about software, markets, and slow travel.</p>

## Background

- 3+ years testing authentication and networking at Fortinet across LDAP, Kerberos, and HTTP/2/3.
- Built automation with Python, Ansible, and CI pipelines to keep complex systems observable.
- Carry reliability thinking into how I allocate time, capital, and attention.

## Currently

- Researching markets and energy infrastructure with AI copilots to surface signals quickly.
- Turning experiments into lightweight tools, from monitoring scripts to travel checklists.
- Writing notes in English and Chinese to compare what works versus what just sounds good.

## Why I write

I share working notes to learn in public, meet fellow systems thinkers, and stay honest about what the data shows.
