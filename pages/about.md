## Multi-Dimensional Bio

<div class="bio-grid">
  <section>
    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>I architect analytics platforms that convert noisy market structure into tradeable intelligence. My core work involves stewarding quantitative research programs, leading cross-border product launches, and translating institutional risk guardrails into programmable systems.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built cross-asset data pipelines that power executive dashboards across APAC.</li>
      <li>Partnered with venture-backed founders to pressure-test market entry blueprints.</li>
      <li>Advised asset allocators on barbell deployments combining cash-flow engines with optionality bets.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>My research obsessions include human-in-the-loop AI, reinforcement learning for portfolio construction, and scenario design for energy transition. I publish synthesis memos that collapse academic, regulatory, and operator perspectives into actionable playbooks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Codified an antifragile positioning framework that blends Kelly sizing with Taleb-inspired convexity.</li>
      <li>Run live notebooks that benchmark frontier AI models against bespoke financial datasets.</li>
      <li>Prototype explainable risk monitors that keep governance synchronized with on-chain telemetry.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>I rotate between Singapore, Hong Kong, and San Francisco, optimizing for communities that blend deep tech, design, and macro sensibilities. Recovery habits include dawn swims, fermentation experiments, and long-form conversations with founders and fund managers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Host small-group salons that connect climate scientists with quant engineers.</li>
      <li>Document travel systems that keep remote collaboration lightweight.</li>
      <li>Cultivate a reading practice anchored in political economy, systems thinking, and speculative fiction.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>I operate like a systems integrator: observe, model, simulate, then intervene. Each engagement begins with a diagnostic map, evolves into a living dashboard, and ends with rituals that keep feedback loops sharp.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blend Bayesian updating with qualitative horizon scanning.</li>
      <li>Ship modular playbooks that compound across teams.</li>
      <li>Document assumptions, measure drift, and close the loop quickly.</li>
    </ul>

## Now

<div class="now-card">
  <p><strong>Current focus:</strong> embedding AI-assisted research co-pilots inside quant workflows, scaling climate-tech due diligence across APAC, and expanding a digital garden of notes that connects policy, markets, and engineering rituals.</p>
  <p><strong>Actively seeking:</strong> collaborators on climate-positive infrastructure, tactical research sprints for venture funds, and experiments that keep teams resilient under volatility.</p>
  <p><strong>Availability:</strong> limited openings for Q2 strategy immersions and lightweight advisory retainers.</p>
</div>

## Ways of Working

1. <strong>Immersive diagnostics.</strong> Every engagement starts with a rapid field study and data audit to surface the core friction.
2. <strong>Co-design sprint.</strong> We design intervention kits—models, dashboards, protocols—that the team can own.
3. <strong>Operational cadence.</strong> We institute rituals that keep signal-to-noise high: weekly scorecards, quarterly scenario reviews, and annual retrospectives.
4. <strong>Knowledge handoff.</strong> All artefacts live in shared repositories with clear versioning, context, and upgrade paths.
