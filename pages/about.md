<p class="lead">I design repeatable systems that compound across software, capital allocation, slow travel, and inner work.</p>

## 30-second snapshot

- Former QA engineer translating reliability instincts into product, infra, and research workflows.
- Building market models that blend automation, narrative tracking, and long-form writing.
- Slow-traveling out of Vancouver and capturing routines that make each city feel like home.

## What I'm exploring right now

### Systems & code

- Leveling up containerization, observability, and end-to-end testing with Docker, Kubernetes, and Playwright.
- Turning QA rigor into tooling that shortens feedback loops for small teams.

### Markets & energy

- Mapping AI datacenter power builds and the capital stack behind them.
- Stress-testing theses with scenario planning, risk limits, and journaled reviews.

### Travel & learning

- Designing travel operating systems that protect deep work while moving between cities.
- Noting how meditation and breathwork influence focus, decision speed, and writing cadence.

## Why this garden exists

To publish working notes on how engineering discipline, market structure, and travel habits reinforce each otherâ€”and to invite conversations with people navigating similar intersections.

## Now

- **Location:** Vancouver, BC  
- **Active projects:** Digital garden overhaul, automation of market memos, and sourcing power-grid data.  
- **Practices:** Daily writing sprints, interval training, and Vipassana sits.
