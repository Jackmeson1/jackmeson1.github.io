## 👋 Who I Am

- 🔧 Former QA Engineer at Fortinet (3 years)
- 📊 Quant-curious researcher exploring AI, energy, and market structure
- ✈️ Slow traveler designing routines that work across cities

## 🎓 Roots

- M.Eng. in Industrial Engineering, Peking University

## 💡 Why This Garden Exists

I left my QA role to create space for cross-disciplinary learning. This site is the notebook where I connect:

- Technical craft from building test infrastructure
- Finance frameworks for antifragile investing
- Travel systems that keep remote work lightweight
- Mind practices that stabilize focus and decision-making

## 📍 Now

- Location: Vancouver, Canada (curious about 日本小樽)
- Reading: *Antifragile* by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
- Learning: Docker, Kubernetes, Playwright
- Thinking about: how systems thinking applies to everyday choices
