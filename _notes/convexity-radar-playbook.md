## Architecture Snapshot

- **Data Spine**: ingest macroeconomic indicators, satellite climate data, and alternative liquidity feeds.
- **Scenario Engine**: run thousands of RL rollouts to stress-test allocations under volatility clusters.
- **Governance Bridge**: translate model outputs into playbooks for investment committees and regulators.

## Operating Rhythms

- Weekly calibration cycles comparing live market drift to simulated outcomes.
- Monthly "convexity summits" aligning research, trading, and compliance stakeholders.
- Quarterly post-mortems capturing learnings from both wins and near-misses.

## Active Questions

- How to incorporate real-time emissions metrics into allocation heuristics?
- What new guardrails are required as agentic tooling becomes more autonomous?
- Which signals predict when to rotate between defensive and opportunistic postures?
