## Ritual Design

Each salon blends three layers:

1. **Signal Briefing** – participants bring one chart or model that captures a current inflection.
2. **Scenario Jam** – small groups stress-test narratives under regulatory, technological, and cultural shifts.
3. **Commitment Round** – attendees list one experiment they will run within two weeks.

## Facilitation Toolkit

- Pre-event questionnaires to understand risk appetites and decision horizons.
- Live Miro canvases to co-map assumptions and potential second-order effects.
- Post-event debrief memos summarizing commitments and resource requests.

## Upgrades in Flight

- Expand the salon archive into an open taxonomy for climate-tech and AI governance questions.
- Embed sentiment pulses before and after each session to measure confidence deltas.
- Pilot asynchronous “micro-salon” kits for distributed teams.
