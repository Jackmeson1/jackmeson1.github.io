## Core Layers

1. **Ingestion Mesh** – connectors ingesting regulatory filings, patent updates, fund announcements, and lab breakthroughs.
2. **Context Harmoniser** – ontology-driven normalisation to align disparate schemas and ensure queryability.
3. **Agent Layer** – retrieval-augmented agents delivering briefings tailored to capital allocators, product leads, and policy teams.

## Governance

- Weekly schema councils review new entity classes and relationship types.
- Drift monitors flag stale or conflicting facts, triggering manual review.
- Access policies map to stakeholder sensitivity tiers to avoid data leakage.

## Next Iterations

- Embed causal inference modules to score how interventions ripple through portfolios.
- Expand connectors into LatAm climate-tech ecosystems.
- Surface network visualisations that highlight under-served founder clusters.
