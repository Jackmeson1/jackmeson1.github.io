## 2. Value Chain Breakdown

### 2.1 Upstream: Raw Materials

#### Lithium
- **Global reserves**: 28 million tons LCE.  
- **Key regions**: Australia (46%), Chile (25%), China (17%).  
- **Price trajectory**

| Period | Battery-grade lithium carbonate | YoY change |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 2023 Q1 | RMB 500,000/ton | +180% |
| 2024 Q1 | RMB 100,000/ton | -80% |
| 2025 Q3 | RMB 85,000/ton | -15% |

**Investment view**
- Near-term oversupply keeps prices anchored at the bottom.  
- Supply-demand balance likely returns after 2026.  
- Favor integrated producers with both resource and refining capacity.

#### Other critical minerals
- **Cobalt**: Consumer electronics demand softens while automotive share rises to 65%.  
- **Nickel**: High-nickel ternary cathodes remain mainstream for premium segments.  
- **Manganese**: LFP-Mn chemistries are emerging, driving incremental demand.

| 4 | Geely | 36 | +55% | 12.3 |
| 5 | NIO | 18 | +31% | 35.6 |

#### Impact of the price war

**Average discounts in 2024**
- RMB 100k–150k segment: -RMB 8,000.  
- RMB 150k–250k segment: -RMB 15,000.  
- Premium segment: relatively stable.

**Implications**
- ✅ Accelerates displacement of ICE vehicles.  
- ✅ Boosts penetration across new buyer cohorts.  
- ⚠️ Compresses OEM margins.  
- ⚠️ Forces weaker brands to exit.

## 4. Investment Strategy

### 4.1 Value distribution across the chain

```
Value allocation for a RMB 300k NEV
├─ Upstream resources: 5% (lithium carbonate RMB 15k)
├─ Midstream battery: 35% (pack RMB 105k)
├─ Downstream assembly: 25% (manufacturing RMB 75k)
└─ Sales & services: 35% (dealer margin RMB 105k)
```

**Profit pool highlights**
- 🏆 **Cell makers**: high technical barriers and scale economics.  
- 🥈 **Premium OEMs**: brand premiums plus lifecycle services.  
- 🥉 **Critical components**: e-motors, power electronics, thermal management.

### 4.2 Segment-level opportunities

#### ⭐ Top picks

**1. Battery materials**  
- **Separators**: high barriers, concentrated market.  
  - ENJIE, Senior Tech.  
- **Electrolytes**: LiPF₆ pricing rebounding.  
  - Tianci Materials, CAPCHEM.

**2. Intelligent components**  
- **LiDAR**: paving the way for L3 autonomy.  
  - Hesai, RoboSense.  
- **Domain controllers**: software-defined vehicles.
