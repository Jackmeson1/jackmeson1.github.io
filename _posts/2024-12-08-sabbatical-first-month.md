Thirty days without sprint boards feels spacious and strange. Here’s how the first month of sabbatical life unfolded.

## Week 1 — Emptying the Calendar

I declined standing meetings, returned my laptop, and slept in without an alarm. The win: noticing how much energy returns when mornings are not filled with pings.

## Week 2 — Micro Adventures

Short trips to Bowen Island and Whistler reminded me that inspiration sits within a two-hour bus ride. I sketched packing lists for longer stays in Asia.

## Week 3 — Rebuilding Practice

Meditation moved from 10-minute app sessions to 30-minute sits with a sangha in East Van. Yoga classes replaced lunch desk lunches. I also reopened my Mandarin notebooks.

## Week 4 — Mapping 日本小樽

Instead of locking flights, I sketched scouting notes for 小樽: seasonal rental options, train links from Sapporo, and where remote work might fit between harbor walks. I’m testing a “three projects” rule: one coding skill, one research question, and one travel experiment at any time.

The through-line is simple: stay curious, stay moving, and document it all here so future-me can see the evolution.
