description: Mapping the inner signals that told me it was time to leave my QA role and design a curiosity-led sabbatical.

On September 25 I turned in my badge at Fortinet. There was no dramatic exit, just a quiet walk out of the office with a backpack full of notebooks.

I didn’t quit because I hated the work. I left because the feedback loops that used to stretch me had gone silent.

## Three Signals That Pushed Me Toward the Door

1. **My meditation log was full of build errors.** Every session devolved into replaying sprint retros. The mind only does that when it has unresolved friction.
2. **Mentorship felt inverted.** I spent more time onboarding people into systems thinking than learning from seniors. That’s a sign the learning curve has flattened.
3. **Curiosity was outsourced to weekends.** Travel, reading, and research waited until after-hours. I wanted to reverse that priority stack.

## What the Sabbatical Is For

- **Rebuild attention.** Daily sits, long-form writing, and slow travel to notice how different cities regulate nervous systems.
- **Practice beginner energy.** I’m diving into Kubernetes, Playwright, and Mandarin copywriting like a junior again.
- **Document the process.** This digital garden is my accountability trail. If an experiment works, I’ll publish the playbook. If it fails, I’ll write about the mess.

## Staying Grounded Without a Corporate Calendar

The rhythms that help:

- Monday morning reflection: What deserves focus this week?
- Wednesday coworking check-in with other sabbatical friends.
- Friday synthesis: Publish notes, ship code snippets, and track how energy shifted.

Leaving a stable job felt risky. But the bigger risk was ignoring the quiet signals that something new wanted space. This garden is the sandbox for whatever comes next.
