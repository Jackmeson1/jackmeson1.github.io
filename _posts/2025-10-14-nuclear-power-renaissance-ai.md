## Executive Summary

**The Pricing Power Thesis:** Constellation Energy (CEG) has achieved something unprecedented in commodity electricity markets—**83-92% premiums** over renewable energy through 20-year fixed-price PPAs with Microsoft and Meta. This isn't irrational exuberance. It's the logical outcome when:

1. AI training cannot tolerate interruption ($14,125/hour loss)
2. Nuclear provides 99.5% uptime vs. wind/solar 25-35%
3. Hyperscalers need 24/7 zero-carbon power for ESG commitments
4. Grid interconnection queues stretch 5-9 years
5. SMR alternatives won't scale until 2029-2032

**The Numbers:**
- **CEG nuclear capacity:** 22.1 GW (3.5x larger than #2 competitor)
- **Microsoft TMI deal:** 835 MW, $110-115/MWh, 20 years = **$86.7B cumulative**
- **Meta Clinton deal:** 1,121 MW, ~$70/MWh, 20 years = **$70.4B cumulative**
- **Combined annual cash flow:** $7.86-9.62B from just 2 contracts
- **Replication potential:** 19 more reactors available for similar deals

**Investment Verdict:** CEG is the **purest play** on AI's structural power demand. While PE 35-39x seems expensive, the Microsoft/Meta contracts fundamentally re-rate the business from commodity generator to premium infrastructure provider.

## Part 1: Why Nuclear Wins for AI

### 1.1 The Reliability Imperative

**AI Training Interruption Economics:**

```
100,000 GPU Cluster Operating Cost:
100K GPUs × $2/GPU-hour = $200K/hour

Single hour interruption:
- Direct loss: $200K operations
- Checkpoint reset: 99 iterations wasted = $110K
- Total: $310K

Annual cost comparison (Tier II vs. Nuclear):
Tier II datacenter: 22 hours downtime × $310K = $6.8M
Nuclear-powered: 1.6 hours downtime × $310K = $496K

Savings: $6.3M annually per 100K GPU cluster
```

**Source:** DDN Research, Google Checkpoint Systems Whitepaper

**Why Nuclear Beats Renewables:**

| Metric | Nuclear | Wind | Solar | Natural Gas |
|--------|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Capacity Factor** | 92-95% | 25-35% | 20-25% | 50-60% |
| **Uptime (Annual)** | 99.5% | Intermittent | Intermittent | 95-97% |
| **Carbon Emissions** | 0 g CO2/kWh | 0 | 0 | 400-500 g |
| **Fuel Cost Volatility** | Low | Zero | Zero | High |
| **Grid Independence** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Key Insight:** For AI training, **reliability > cost**. Nuclear is the only technology delivering 24/7 zero-carbon baseload power with 99.5%+ uptime.

### 1.2 The Microsoft Economics

**Why Pay $110-115/MWh vs. $60/MWh for Renewables?**

**Scenario Analysis:**

```
Option A: Renewable Energy (Wind/Solar + Battery)
- PPA price: $60/MWh
- Capacity factor: 30%
- Intermittency: Forces backup power or training delays
- Battery storage: Adds $40/MWh (4-hour duration)
- Effective cost: $100/MWh + reliability risk

Option B: Nuclear (Three Mile Island)
- PPA price: $110/MWh
- Capacity factor: 93%
- Uptime: 99.5% (24/7/365)
- No backup needed
- Total cost: $110/MWh, zero risk

Premium: $10-15/MWh
Interruption insurance value: $14,125/hour ÷ 835 MW = $16.9/MWh

ROI on premium:
$16.9/MWh insurance > $10-15/MWh cost
Positive arbitrage = Rational decision
```

**ESG Multiplier:**
- Microsoft's 2030 commitment: **Carbon negative**
- Nuclear: Only 24/7 zero-carbon technology at scale
- Wind/solar + batteries: Still has embodied carbon, intermittency issues
- **Reputational value:** Priceless for $3T market cap company

| Others | ~12 GW | ~22% | Fragmented |

**Source:** World Nuclear Association, Company filings

**Strategic Implication:** CEG's 3.5x scale advantage over #2 creates quasi-monopoly pricing power for AI datacenter deals.

### 2.2 Microsoft Three Mile Island Deal

**Project Overview:**
- **Facility:** Three Mile Island Unit 1 (TMI-1)
- **Capacity:** 835 MW
- **Status:** Retired 2019, restart planned 2027 (ahead of original 2028 schedule)
- **Investment:** ~$1.6B refurbishment
- **Contract:** 20-year fixed-price PPA with Microsoft

**Timeline:**
- **2025 Q2:** Project announced, regulatory approval initiated
- **2025 Q3:** "Ahead of schedule" confirmed by CEG
- **2026-2027:** Refurbishment and NRC re-licensing
- **2027:** Commercial operations (1 year ahead of plan)

**Financial Model:**

| Scenario | PPA Price | Annual Revenue | Annual O&M | Net Cash Flow | 20-Year NPV |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Conservative** | $100/MWh | $655M | $262M | $393M | $7.86B |
| **Base Case** | $110/MWh | $721M | $287M | $434M | $8.67B |
| **Optimistic** | $115/MWh | $753M | $295M | $458M | $9.16B |

**Assumptions:**
- Capacity factor: 90% (conservative vs. 94.8% fleet average)
- Annual generation: 835 MW × 8,760 hours × 90% = 6.55 TWh
- O&M cost: $30-40/MWh (industry standard)
- Discount rate: 6% (investment-grade utility WACC)
- **Not including:** Federal 45Y PTC (production tax credit) = additional $5-10/MWh benefit

**Payback Analysis:**
```
Investment: $1.6B
Annual net cash flow: $434M (base case)
Simple payback: 3.7 years
IRR: ~25% (exceptional for infrastructure)
```

**Why This Matters:** The Microsoft deal alone adds **$8.67B NPV** to CEG's valuation—roughly 10% of current market cap from a single asset restart.

### 2.3 Meta Clinton Nuclear Station Deal

**Project Overview:**
- **Facility:** Clinton Nuclear Station (Illinois)
- **Capacity:** 1,121 MW (entire plant output)
- **Status:** Operating asset (no restart required)
- **Contract:** 20-year PPA with Meta, starting June 2027
- **Upgrade:** +30 MW power uprate included

**Financial Model:**

| Scenario | PPA Price | Annual Revenue | Annual O&M | Net Cash Flow | 20-Year NPV |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Jefferies Est.** | $70/MWh | $616M | $264M | $352M | $7.04B |
| **Market Est.** | $85/MWh | $748M | $308M | $440M | $8.80B |
| **Bull Case** | $100/MWh | $880M | $352M | $528M | $10.56B |

**Assumptions:**
- Capacity factor: 90%
- Annual generation: 1,121 MW × 8,760 × 90% = 8.8 TWh
- O&M: $30-40/MWh

**Key Observations:**

1. **Lower pricing than Microsoft** ($70 vs. $110/MWh):
   - Clinton is existing asset (no restart capital risk)
   - Meta signed earlier (less competitive bidding)
   - Still **17-42% premium** over renewable PPAs ($50-60/MWh)

2. **Larger capacity** (1,121 MW vs. 835 MW):
   - Compensates for lower price
   - Similar total value contribution

3. **Earlier delivery** (June 2027):
   - Provides cash flow before TMI-1
   - De-risks restart execution

**Combined Microsoft + Meta Value:**
```
Conservative (TMI $110/MWh + Clinton $70/MWh):
Annual: $434M + $352M = $786M
20-year: $8.67B + $7.04B = $15.71B

Optimistic (Both $110/MWh):
Annual: $434M + $528M = $962M
20-year: $8.67B + $10.56B = $19.23B
```

**Strategic Significance:** Two contracts alone could add **$15-19B NPV**, roughly 15-20% of CEG's current enterprise value.

## Part 3: Replication Potential

### 3.1 CEG's Remaining Assets

**Available for Additional PPAs:**

```
Total CEG nuclear: 22.1 GW
Already contracted:
- Microsoft TMI: 0.835 GW
- Meta Clinton: 1.121 GW
Subtotal: 1.956 GW (9%)

Remaining capacity: 20.1 GW (91%)
```

**CEO Guidance (Q2 2025 Earnings):**
> "We are in discussions with large customers regarding projects of **unprecedented scale and capacity**."

**Translation:** More hyperscaler deals in pipeline.

### 3.2 Replication Scenarios

**Conservative Case (5 GW by 2028):**
```
5 GW × 8,760 hours × 90% CF = 39.4 TWh/year
At $100/MWh average: $3.94B annual revenue
Less O&M (35%): $2.56B annual net cash flow
20-year NPV (6% discount): $51.2B
```

**Base Case (10 GW by 2030):**
```
10 GW × 8,760 × 90% = 78.8 TWh/year
At $100/MWh: $7.88B revenue
Net cash flow: $5.12B annually
20-year NPV: $102.4B
```

**Bull Case (15 GW by 2032):**
```
15 GW × 8,760 × 90% = 118.2 TWh/year
At $100/MWh: $11.82B revenue
Net cash flow: $7.68B annually
20-year NPV: $153.6B
```

**Reality Check:**
- **Hyperscaler AI capex:** $200-300B annually (AWS, Azure, GCP, Meta combined)
- **Power as % of capex:** ~15-20%
- **Available for nuclear PPAs:** $30-60B annually
- **CEG's addressable:** 10-15 GW over 5-10 years = plausible

| **NuScale** | Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) | 77 MWe | TVA + Entra1 | 2029-2030 |
| **X-energy** | High-Temp Gas Reactor (HTGR) | 80 MWe | Amazon | 2030-2032 |
| **Kairos Power** | Molten Salt Reactor | 140 MWe | Google | 2030+ |
| **TerraPower** | Sodium Fast Reactor | 345 MWe | No announcement | 2030s |
| **Oklo** | Fast Reactor | 15 MWe | No major deals | 2027-2030 |

**Source:** World Nuclear News, Company announcements, NRC filings

### 4.2 NuScale Deep Dive

**Business Model:**
- **Technology:** VOYGR™ plant with 4-12 modules per site
- **Typical config:** 6-module plant (462 MWe total)
- **Differentiation:** NRC-approved design (only SMR with full certification)

**Major Contract: TVA + Entra1**
- **Scope:** 6 nuclear plants, NuScale SMRs
- **Total capacity:** ~6 GW (if 12-module configurations)
- **Timeline:** First units 2029-2030
- **Status:** Early engineering, no construction started

**Historical Red Flag:**
- **2023:** Carbon Free Power Project (UAMPS) **cancelled**
  - Reason: Cost overruns, insufficient customer commitments
  - Impact: Raised execution risk concerns

**Investment Implications:**
- ✅ **Upside:** If successful, 10x+ potential (early-stage tech)
- ⚠️ **Risk:** Execution, cost overruns, regulatory delays
- ⏰ **Timeline:** 2029+ commercialization (4-5 years out)

### 4.3 Hyperscaler SMR Strategy

**Amazon (X-energy):**
- **Investment:** $500M direct equity
- **Capacity target:** Undisclosed (likely 1-2 GW)
- **Rationale:** Long-term optionality, 2030+ supply

**Google (Kairos Power):**
- **Contract:** 500 MW total capacity
- **Delivery:** 2030 onward (staged rollout)
- **Rationale:** Diversification, molten salt tech interest

**Microsoft & Meta:**
- **Strategy:** Bet on CEG existing nuclear (2025-2030)
- **Rationale:** Need power **now**, can't wait for SMRs

**Key Observation:** Hyperscalers are **hedging**:
- Short-term (2025-2030): CEG existing reactors
- Long-term (2030+): SMR options

**This validates CEG's 5-10 year exclusive window.**

### 4.4 Why SMRs Don't Threaten CEG (Yet)

**Timeline Reality:**
```
SMR Commercial Readiness:
2025-2027: Engineering, permitting, early construction
2028-2029: First units commission (NuScale best case)
2030-2032: Volume production ramps

CEG Exclusive Window: 2025-2030 (5 years minimum)
```

**During This Window:**
- CEG can sign 10-15 GW additional PPAs
- Lock in 20-year contracts (extends to 2045-2050)
- Build customer relationships & operational integration

**Post-2030 CEG Response:**
- Deploy SMRs at existing sites (NRC license, grid connection advantages)
- Operate SMRs for hyperscalers (leveraging nuclear expertise)
- Worst case: 2030+ growth slows, but 2025-2030 contracts are locked

**Investment Implication:** CEG doesn't need to "win forever"—just capture the 2025-2030 buildout, which is already happening.
