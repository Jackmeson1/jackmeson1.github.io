## 1. Industry Backdrop

### 1.1 Explosive Growth in AI Compute

International Energy Agency (IEA) data show:
- 2023 global data center power usage reached **460 TWh**, roughly **2%** of worldwide electricity demand.
- By 2030, consumption is projected to climb to **1,000 TWh**.
- The share of electricity dedicated to AI training workloads rose from 15% in 2020 to 35% in 2024.

### 1.2 Rising Compute Density

| Metric | 2020 | 2023 | 2026E |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Power per rack (kW) | 5–8 | 15–20 | 40–60 |
| GPU cluster size | 1K | 10K | 100K+ |
| Training cycle power (MWh) | 50 | 500 | 5,000+ |

## 2. Value Chain Overview

### 2.1 Upstream: Generation

**Beneficiaries**
1. **Clean energy**  
   - Accelerating solar and wind installations.  
   - Strong demand for co-located storage.  
   - Expanding green power trading markets.

2. **Conventional power**  
   - Natural gas for peak shaving.  
   - Nuclear to secure baseload supply.

### 2.2 Midstream: Transmission & Distribution

**Key challenges**
- Local grids lack spare capacity.  
- Transformers require accelerated upgrades.  
- Grid operators need smarter dispatching systems.

**Investment angles**
- Ultra-high-voltage transmission hardware.  
- Distribution automation platforms.  
- Grid-level storage deployments.

### 2.3 Downstream: Data Centers

**Technology evolution**
```
Legacy data center → Hyperscale campus → Liquid-cooled facility
PUE 1.6–2.0       → PUE 1.3–1.5      → PUE 1.1–1.2
```

**Key metrics comparison**

| Type | PUE | Power per rack | Payback period |
|------|-----|----------------|----------------|
| Traditional air cooling | 1.6 | 8 kW | 8–10 yrs |
| Indirect liquid cooling | 1.3 | 30 kW | 6–8 yrs |
| Immersion cooling | 1.1 | 100 kW | 5–7 yrs |

## 3. Financial Modeling

### 3.1 Estimating Power Costs

Example: training a GPT-4–class model

```
Total compute: 25,000 GPUs × 90 days × 24 hours
Power per GPU: 700 W
Total electricity: 25,000 × 0.7 kW × 90 × 24 = 37,800 MWh

At an industrial tariff of RMB 0.6/kWh:
Power cost: 37,800,000 × 0.6 = RMB 22.68M
Share of total training budget: ~30%
```

### 3.2 Data Center Operating Model

**Revenue streams**
- Cabinet leasing: RMB 8,000–15,000 per kW per year.  
- GPU-as-a-service: RMB 2–5 per card per hour.

**Cost structure**
- Electricity: 50–60% of operating expenses.  
- Bandwidth: 15–20%.  
- Personnel: 10–15%.

**Blended gross margin**: 35–45% for the sector.
