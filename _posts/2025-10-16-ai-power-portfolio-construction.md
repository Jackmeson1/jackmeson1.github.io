## Executive Summary

After analyzing the [industry backdrop](/finance/2025/10/12/ai-datacenter-power-revolution/), [equipment landscape](/finance/2025/10/13/liquid-cooling-thermal-management/), [nuclear economics](/finance/2025/10/14/nuclear-power-renaissance-ai/), and [grid constraints](/finance/2025/10/15/grid-infrastructure-onsite-generation/), we now construct actionable portfolios.

**Key Investment Thesis:**
- AI datacenter power demand: 300 TWh (2024) → 945 TWh (2030) = 216% growth
- Four validated plays: CEG (nuclear baseload), Vertiv (liquid cooling), Eaton (grid infrastructure), Bloom (on-site generation)
- Time horizon: 3-5 years minimum (infrastructure cycles are measured in decades)
- Risk profile: Lower than AI software (physical infrastructure is defensible moat)

**Portfolio Recommendations:**

| Risk Profile | AI Power Allocation | CEG | Vertiv | Eaton | Bloom | Expected Annual Return |
|--------------|---------------------|-----|--------|-------|-------|------------------------|
| **Conservative** | 30-40% | 50% | 25% | 20% | 5% | 12-18% |
| **Balanced** | 50-60% | 40% | 30% | 20% | 10% | 18-25% |
| **Aggressive** | 70-80% | 35% | 35% | 15% | 15% | 25-40% |

This article provides batch buying strategies, position sizing rules, rebalancing triggers, and a final investment checklist.

## Portfolio Construction Framework

### Investment Universe: Four Validated Plays

Based on value chain analysis from previous articles, we focus on four companies with **defensible moats, pricing power, and AI-driven growth certainty**:

**1. Constellation Energy (CEG) - 35-50% of AI power allocation**
- **Why dominant:** 91% of nuclear fleet available for replication, Microsoft/Meta deals prove $70-110/MWh PPA economics
- **Moat:** 20.1 GW nuclear capacity cannot be replicated (NRC approvals take decades)
- **Risk:** Regulatory (NRC restart approvals), execution (TMI restart by 2028), nuclear incidents

**2. Vertiv (VRT) - 25-35% of allocation**
- **Why critical:** GB200 racks require liquid cooling (120-132 kW/rack vs air's 25 kW limit)
- **Moat:** NVIDIA partnership, $8.5B backlog, $5-10M/MW switching costs
- **Risk:** Execution (scaling production 10x), competition (Schneider Electric), margin compression

**3. Eaton (ETN) - 15-20% of allocation**
- **Why essential:** Every datacenter needs transformers, switchgear, UPS (grid or on-site)
- **Moat:** $11.4B backlog (+17% YoY), diversified end markets reduce AI dependency
- **Risk:** Lower growth rate than Vertiv/Bloom, cyclical exposure to industrial markets

**4. Bloom Energy (BE) - 5-15% of allocation**
- **Why asymmetric:** 1% market share (2024) → 27% (2030) if grid bottlenecks persist
- **Moat:** SOFC technology bypasses 9-year grid queues, 90-day deployment vs 11-year grid connection
- **Risk:** Unproven at scale, hydrogen fuel costs, utility policy changes, higher volatility

---

## Conservative Portfolio (30-40% AI Power Allocation)

**Profile:** Retirees, income-focused investors, risk-averse individuals

**Total Portfolio Example:** $1,000,000
- **AI Power Allocation:** $350,000 (35%)
- **Remaining:** $650,000 in diversified equities, bonds, REITs

**AI Power Breakdown:**

| Stock | Allocation | Dollar Amount | Rationale |
|-------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **CEG** | 50% | $175,000 | Nuclear baseload is lowest risk (proven PPAs, regulated utility) |
| **Vertiv** | 25% | $87,500 | Liquid cooling is necessity, not option (GB200 physics) |
| **Eaton** | 20% | $70,000 | Infrastructure play with diversified revenue (not AI-only) |
| **Bloom** | 5% | $17,500 | Small asymmetric bet (high risk, high reward) |

### Batch Buying Strategy (Conservative)

**CEG - 3 Batches:**
1. **Immediate (40% = $70,000):** Buy now at current price (~$250-280)
   - Rationale: Microsoft/Meta deals are signed, TMI restart approved
2. **NRC Milestone (30% = $52,500):** Buy when TMI restart receives final NRC operating license
   - Trigger: Watch NRC press releases (expected Q2 2026)
3. **Validation (30% = $52,500):** Buy after TMI successfully restarts and runs 90 days
   - Trigger: CEG earnings call confirms TMI commercial operation

**Vertiv - 2 Batches (Conservative Risk Management):**
1. **Immediate (60% = $52,500):** Buy now
   - Rationale: $8.5B backlog already locked in, GB200 rollout underway
2. **Quarterly Beat (40% = $35,000):** Buy after 2 consecutive quarters of revenue/margin beat
   - Trigger: Watch Q1/Q2 2026 earnings (should see GB200 revenue acceleration)

**Eaton - Single Batch:**
- **Immediate (100% = $70,000):** Buy now
   - Rationale: Lowest risk (PE 25x vs Vertiv 35x), diversified revenue, stable margins

**Bloom - 3 Batches (Highest Risk, Smallest Position):**
1. **AEP Order (40% = $7,000):** Buy only if AEP/utility announces large SOFC order
   - Catalyst: Watch for press releases (AEP explored 1 GW SOFC in 2024)
2. **Post-Earnings (30% = $5,250):** Buy after quarterly gross margin exceeds 25%
   - Trigger: Watch Q4 2025 or Q1 2026 earnings
3. **Utility Proof (30% = $5,250):** Buy after successful 12-month utility deployment
   - Trigger: Wait for case study/press release from utility customer

### Risk Management Rules (Conservative)

**Position Limits:**
- No single stock exceeds 17.5% of total portfolio (CEG at $175K / $1M)
- AI power allocation capped at 40% maximum

**Stop-Loss Triggers:**
- **CEG:** Sell if NRC denies TMI restart or nuclear incident occurs (Three Mile Island déjà vu)
- **Vertiv:** Sell if quarterly revenue growth drops below 10% for 2 consecutive quarters
- **Eaton:** Sell if datacenter segment revenue declines YoY (indicates demand slowdown)
- **Bloom:** Sell if gross margin drops below 15% (indicates unsustainable economics)

**Rebalancing:**
- Quarterly rebalancing: If any stock exceeds target allocation by >30%, trim to target
- Example: If Vertiv rallies from $87.5K to $120K (37% over target), sell $32.5K to restore 25% weight

---

## Balanced Portfolio (50-60% AI Power Allocation)

**Profile:** Mid-career professionals, growth-focused investors, moderate risk tolerance

**Total Portfolio Example:** $500,000
- **AI Power Allocation:** $275,000 (55%)
- **Remaining:** $225,000 in diversified equities, bonds

**AI Power Breakdown:**

| Stock | Allocation | Dollar Amount | Rationale |
|-------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **CEG** | 40% | $110,000 | Still largest position (nuclear moat) but room for growth plays |
| **Vertiv** | 30% | $82,500 | Increased weight (liquid cooling TAM explosion) |
| **Eaton** | 20% | $55,000 | Stable infrastructure exposure |
| **Bloom** | 10% | $27,500 | Larger asymmetric bet (2x conservative allocation) |

### Batch Buying Strategy (Balanced)

**CEG - 3 Batches:**
1. **Immediate (50% = $55,000):** Buy now (more aggressive than conservative 40%)
2. **NRC Milestone (25% = $27,500):** Buy on TMI operating license
3. **Validation (25% = $27,500):** Buy after 90-day successful operation

**Vertiv - 3 Batches:**
1. **Immediate (50% = $41,250):** Buy now
2. **Quarterly Beat (30% = $24,750):** Buy after 1 quarter of revenue/margin beat (faster than conservative)
3. **New Tech Rollout (20% = $16,500):** Buy when Vertiv announces next-gen liquid cooling (beyond GB200)

**Eaton - 2 Batches:**
1. **Immediate (70% = $38,500):** Buy now
2. **Backlog Acceleration (30% = $16,500):** Buy if datacenter backlog grows >25% YoY

**Bloom - 3 Batches:**
1. **Immediate (40% = $11,000):** Buy now (balanced investors take earlier risk)
2. **AEP/Utility Order (30% = $8,250):** Buy on large utility SOFC order
3. **Post-Earnings (30% = $8,250):** Buy after gross margin exceeds 25%

### Risk Management Rules (Balanced)

**Position Limits:**
- No single stock exceeds 22% of total portfolio (CEG at $110K / $500K)
- AI power allocation capped at 60% maximum

**Stop-Loss Triggers:**
- **CEG:** Sell 50% if NRC delays TMI restart beyond 2028 (de-risk, but don't exit entirely)
- **Vertiv:** Sell if quarterly revenue growth drops below 15% for 2 consecutive quarters
- **Eaton:** Sell if datacenter segment revenue declines 2 quarters in a row
- **Bloom:** Sell if gross margin drops below 18% (slightly higher tolerance than conservative)

**Rebalancing:**
- Quarterly rebalancing: If any stock exceeds target by >40%, trim to target
- Annual review: Reassess AI power allocation (if CEG/Vertiv double, consider trimming to 50%)

---

## Aggressive Portfolio (70-80% AI Power Allocation)

**Profile:** Young professionals, high risk tolerance, long time horizon (10+ years)

**Total Portfolio Example:** $250,000
- **AI Power Allocation:** $187,500 (75%)
- **Remaining:** $62,500 in cash or bonds (safety net)

**AI Power Breakdown:**

| Stock | Allocation | Dollar Amount | Rationale |
|-------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **CEG** | 35% | $65,625 | Lower weight (more room for high-growth plays) |
| **Vertiv** | 35% | $65,625 | Equal weight with CEG (betting on liquid cooling TAM) |
| **Eaton** | 15% | $28,125 | Reduced weight (lower growth rate) |
| **Bloom** | 15% | $28,125 | Largest asymmetric bet (3x conservative allocation) |

### Batch Buying Strategy (Aggressive)

**CEG - 2 Batches (Faster Deployment):**
1. **Immediate (60% = $39,375):** Buy now (most aggressive entry)
2. **NRC Milestone (40% = $26,250):** Buy on TMI operating license (skip validation wait)

**Vertiv - 2 Batches:**
1. **Immediate (70% = $45,938):** Buy now (bet on GB200 rollout acceleration)
2. **Quarterly Beat (30% = $19,687):** Buy after 1 quarter beat

**Eaton - Single Batch:**
- **Immediate (100% = $28,125):** Buy now (stable, lower priority)

**Bloom - 2 Batches (Highest Conviction on Asymmetry):**
1. **Immediate (60% = $16,875):** Buy now (aggressive bet on grid bottleneck thesis)
2. **AEP/Utility Order (40% = $11,250):** Buy on large utility order

### Risk Management Rules (Aggressive)

**Position Limits:**
- No single stock exceeds 26% of total portfolio (CEG/Vertiv at $65.6K / $250K)
- AI power allocation capped at 80% maximum (always keep 20% cash/bonds)

**Stop-Loss Triggers:**
- **CEG:** Hold through NRC delays (only sell on denial or nuclear incident)
- **Vertiv:** Sell if quarterly revenue growth drops below 20% for 2 consecutive quarters
- **Eaton:** Sell if datacenter segment revenue declines 3 quarters in a row
- **Bloom:** Sell if gross margin drops below 20% (higher tolerance for volatility)

**Rebalancing:**
- Semi-annual rebalancing: If any stock exceeds target by >50%, trim to target
- Annual review: Consider increasing AI power allocation if thesis strengthens (e.g., 80% → 85%)

**Leverage (Optional for Aggressive Investors):**
- If comfortable with options: Sell cash-secured puts on CEG/Vertiv to generate income
- Example: Sell CEG $250 puts expiring 30-60 days, collect premium, willing to buy if assigned
- **Warning:** Only for investors who understand options risk and can handle assignment

## What to Avoid: Value Traps and False Narratives

### 1. Datacenter REITs (Digital Realty, Equinix, CyrusOne)

**Why avoid:**
- **No pricing power:** Tenants (hyperscalers) negotiate 10-15 year leases with fixed rent
- **Margin compression:** REITs pay for power infrastructure (transformers, cooling) but can't pass through GB200's 10x power density increase
- **Power capacity constraints:** Existing datacenters built for 8-15 kW/rack cannot retrofit to 150 kW without gutting buildings
- **Better alternatives:** CEG/Vertiv/Eaton sell equipment to REITs (suppliers capture value, not landlords)

**Data point:** Digital Realty trades at 15x FFO, same valuation as 2019, despite AI boom (market recognizes margin pressure).

### 2. Commodity Plays (Uranium miners, copper miners, natural gas producers)

**Why avoid:**
- **Price takers, not makers:** Commodity prices are set by global supply/demand, not AI datacenter demand
- **Uranium:** Spot price volatility (Cameco, Kazatomprom benefit, but CEG locks in $70-110/MWh PPAs regardless of uranium price)
- **Copper:** AI datacenters use more copper, but so do EVs, grid buildout, housing (diluted thesis)
- **Natural gas:** On-site generation (Bloom SOFC) uses natural gas, but residential/industrial demand dwarfs datacenter demand

**Better alternative:** CEG (locks in power pricing via PPAs), Bloom (passes through fuel costs to customers).

### 3. Renewable Energy Developers (NextEra, Orsted, Brookfield Renewable)

**Why avoid:**
- **Intermittency kills AI:** Datacenters need 99.99% uptime, solar/wind cannot provide baseload without massive battery storage
- **Battery economics broken:** $300-500/kWh battery cost makes 24/7 solar+storage 2-3x more expensive than nuclear
- **Hyperscalers prefer nuclear:** Microsoft (TMI), Meta (Clinton), Google (NuScale SMR) all signing nuclear PPAs, not solar/wind

**Data point:** Google's 2024 carbon emissions increased 13% despite renewable investments (AI datacenter growth outpaced clean energy).

### 4. Bitcoin Miner Conversions (Core Scientific, Riot Platforms)

**Why avoid:**
- **Retrofit costs equal new build:** $18M/MW to retrofit bitcoin mining facility ≈ $15-20M/MW to build new datacenter
- **Wrong power profile:** Bitcoin miners optimized for cheap, interruptible power (curtail during high prices), AI needs 24/7 baseload
- **Geographic mismatch:** Bitcoin miners in Texas/Wyoming (cheap power, far from fiber), AI datacenters need low-latency metro locations
- **Execution risk:** Core Scientific's IBIT deal (2024) involves building NEW datacenters, not retrofitting old ones (proves conversion thesis is broken)

**Better alternative:** Bloom Energy (on-site generation avoids grid constraints without retrofit costs).

### 5. Utility Companies (Southern Company, Duke Energy, Dominion)

**Why avoid:**
- **Regulated returns cap upside:** Utilities earn 9-11% ROE regulated by state commissions, cannot capture AI datacenter pricing power
- **Grid buildout costs passed through:** PJM capacity auctions hit $329/MW-day (16x increase), but utilities recover costs via rate base, no excess profit
- **Long development timelines:** 5-10 years to build new transmission, AI datacenters need power in 18-24 months (mismatch)

**Exception:** CEG is technically a utility but earns unregulated merchant power pricing via PPAs (not capped at 9-11% ROE).

## Batch Buying Execution Guide

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Open Brokerage Account:**
- Use low-cost broker (Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, Schwab)
- Enable real-time quotes for CEG, VRT, ETN, BE
- Set up price alerts (e.g., alert if CEG drops 5% in one day)

**2. Determine Your Risk Profile:**
- Conservative: 30-40% AI power allocation
- Balanced: 50-60% allocation
- Aggressive: 70-80% allocation

**3. Calculate Dollar Amounts:**
- Example (Balanced, $500K portfolio):
  - CEG: $110,000 → Batch 1: $55,000, Batch 2: $27,500, Batch 3: $27,500
  - Vertiv: $82,500 → Batch 1: $41,250, Batch 2: $24,750, Batch 3: $16,500
  - Eaton: $55,000 → Batch 1: $38,500, Batch 2: $16,500
  - Bloom: $27,500 → Batch 1: $11,000, Batch 2: $8,250, Batch 3: $8,250

**4. Execute Batch 1 (Immediate Buys):**
- Place **limit orders** (not market orders) to avoid slippage
- Example: If CEG trades at $270, place limit order at $272 (gives 0.7% buffer)
- Avoid buying all on same day (spread over 1 week to reduce timing risk)

**5. Set Calendar Reminders for Batch 2/3 Triggers:**
- **CEG Batch 2:** Google Calendar alert "Check NRC website for TMI operating license" (monthly check)
- **Vertiv Batch 2:** Calendar alert "Check Vertiv Q1 2026 earnings" (quarterly)
- **Bloom Batch 2:** Google News alert "AEP SOFC order" or "Bloom Energy utility"

**6. Monitor Stop-Loss Triggers:**
- Set price alerts 10% below stop-loss levels
- Example (Conservative): If CEG stop-loss is "NRC denial," set alert if CEG drops 15% in one day (signals bad news)

**7. Quarterly Rebalancing:**
- Export portfolio to Excel/Google Sheets
- Calculate actual vs target allocation
- If deviation >30% (Conservative) or >40% (Balanced) or >50% (Aggressive), rebalance

## Risk Management Checklist

### Diversification Rules

**Geographic Diversification (Not Required):**
- All four companies operate in US (CEG: US nuclear fleet, Vertiv: global but US-heavy, Eaton: global, Bloom: US-only)
- AI datacenter buildout is US-centric (Microsoft/Meta/Google all building in US)
- **Conclusion:** Geographic diversification is not a concern for this thesis

**Sector Diversification:**
- CEG: Utilities (nuclear power generation)
- Vertiv: Industrials (thermal management equipment)
- Eaton: Industrials (electrical components)
- Bloom: Industrials (on-site power generation)
- **Concern:** 75% industrials concentration (Vertiv/Eaton/Bloom)
- **Mitigation:** This is acceptable because industrials benefit from AI capex cycle (different sub-sectors)

**Single Stock Limits:**
- Conservative: No stock >17.5% of total portfolio
- Balanced: No stock >22%
- Aggressive: No stock >26%

### Correlation Analysis

**Portfolio Correlation Matrix (Estimated):**

|       | CEG  | Vertiv | Eaton | Bloom |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-------|
| **CEG** | 1.0  | 0.6    | 0.5   | 0.5   |
| **Vertiv** | 0.6  | 1.0    | 0.7   | 0.6   |
| **Eaton** | 0.5  | 0.7    | 1.0   | 0.5   |
| **Bloom** | 0.5  | 0.6    | 0.5   | 1.0   |

**Interpretation:**
- Moderate correlation (0.5-0.7) is expected (all benefit from AI datacenter buildout)
- CEG has lowest correlation (nuclear PPA economics differ from equipment sales)
- Bloom has lowest correlation (on-site generation is alternative to grid, not complement)

**Implication:** Diversification benefit exists but limited (all stocks rise/fall together in AI bull/bear market).

### Stress Testing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: AI Winter (ChatGPT hype fades, capex cuts)**
- **CEG impact:** Low (Microsoft/Meta PPAs already signed, 20-year commitments)
- **Vertiv impact:** High (equipment orders dry up, backlog shrinks)
- **Eaton impact:** Medium (diversified revenue cushions blow, but datacenter segment declines)
- **Bloom impact:** Severe (unproven technology, customers cancel orders)
- **Portfolio action:** Sell Bloom immediately, trim Vertiv to 15%, hold CEG/Eaton

**Scenario 2: Nuclear Incident (Three Mile Island déjà vu or Fukushima-style disaster)**
- **CEG impact:** Severe (stock could drop 30-50%, NRC halts all restarts)
- **Vertiv impact:** Low (liquid cooling demand unaffected)
- **Eaton impact:** Low (grid infrastructure unaffected)
- **Bloom impact:** Positive (on-site generation becomes preferred over nuclear)
- **Portfolio action:** Sell CEG entirely, rotate to Bloom (asymmetric hedge)

**Scenario 3: Grid Buildout Breakthrough (PJM approves fast-track interconnections)**
- **CEG impact:** Low (nuclear PPAs still economical vs grid power)
- **Vertiv impact:** Low (liquid cooling still required for GB200)
- **Eaton impact:** Positive (more grid connections = more switchgear/transformer sales)
- **Bloom impact:** Severe (on-site generation thesis collapses if grid delays disappear)
- **Portfolio action:** Sell Bloom, rotate to Eaton

**Scenario 4: Breakthrough Cooling Technology (Air cooling solves 150 kW/rack somehow)**
- **CEG impact:** Low (power demand still increases, just less cooling load)
- **Vertiv impact:** Severe (liquid cooling TAM collapses)
- **Eaton impact:** Low (datacenters still need electrical infrastructure)
- **Bloom impact:** Low (on-site generation demand unaffected)
- **Portfolio action:** Sell Vertiv immediately, rotate to CEG/Eaton

### Tax Optimization (US Investors)

**Holding Period:**
- **Long-term capital gains:** Hold >1 year for 15-20% tax rate (vs 22-37% ordinary income)
- **Batch buying advantage:** Batch 1 (immediate) reaches long-term gains first, Batch 2/3 lag by 6-12 months

**Tax-Loss Harvesting:**
- If any stock drops >20% and thesis breaks, sell for tax loss
- Example: Bloom drops from $28,125 to $15,000 (-47%), sell for $13,125 loss, offset capital gains elsewhere

**Account Type Selection:**
- **Roth IRA (best):** Tax-free growth, ideal for aggressive portfolio (20-30% annual returns compounding tax-free)
- **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deferred growth, suitable for balanced portfolio
- **Taxable account:** Use for conservative portfolio (lower turnover, long-term capital gains treatment)

## Conclusion: Three-Year Roadmap

**Year 1 (2025-2026): Foundation Building**
- Execute Batch 1 buys (CEG/Vertiv/Eaton immediate, Bloom if AEP order confirmed)
- Monitor TMI restart progress (NRC milestones)
- Watch Vertiv quarterly earnings for GB200 revenue ramp
- Expect 10-20% volatility (AI hype cycles, macro uncertainty)

**Year 2 (2026-2027): Validation Phase**
- Execute Batch 2/3 buys as triggers hit (CEG NRC approval, Vertiv earnings beats)
- TMI restart goes live (CEG validates nuclear PPA thesis)
- GB200 deployments at scale (Vertiv proves liquid cooling TAM)
- First utility SOFC deployments (Bloom proves grid bypass thesis)
- Portfolio gains: 25-40% (if thesis plays out)

**Year 3 (2027-2028): Replication Phase**
- CEG replicates TMI deal with additional customers (Amazon, Oracle, etc.)
- Vertiv expands beyond NVIDIA (AMD MI300, Intel Gaudi, custom chips)
- Eaton backlog compounds as more datacenters break ground
- Bloom achieves 10%+ market share (if grid bottlenecks persist)
- Portfolio gains: 50-100% cumulative (if all four plays succeed)

**Exit Criteria:**
- **CEG:** Sell when 50%+ of nuclear fleet is locked into PPAs (scarcity value diminishes)
- **Vertiv:** Sell when gross margin compresses below 30% (competition intensifies)
- **Eaton:** Sell when datacenter backlog growth slows below 10% YoY (demand peak)
- **Bloom:** Sell when market share exceeds 30% (diminishing returns from grid bypass thesis)

**Final Thought:**
This is a **3-5 year infrastructure build-out cycle**, not a 6-month trade. AI power demand is non-negotiable (ChatGPT needs electricity, physics cannot be disrupted). The companies with **defensible moats, pricing power, and execution track records** will compound capital for patient investors.

The four plays—CEG (nuclear), Vertiv (cooling), Eaton (grid), Bloom (on-site)—are not "picks and shovels" clichés. They are **critical path dependencies** in the AI supply chain. Build your portfolio, follow the batch buying plan, and let infrastructure economics work in your favor.
