# CSS Loading Fix - Resolved

## Problem

The website was displaying as **plain HTML without any styling**:
- No theme styles loaded
- Skip links visible at top
- All text in default browser font
- No colors, spacing, or layout
- Plain text navigation

## Root Cause

In `_config.yml`, there was an incorrect configuration:

```yaml
remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"
skin: "/assets/css/skins/default.css"  # ❌ WRONG - file doesn't exist
```

The `skin` parameter was pointing to `/assets/css/skins/default.css`, which doesn't exist in the repository. This prevented the So Simple theme from loading its default styles.

## Solution

Removed the incorrect `skin` line from `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"
# Skin defaults to the theme's default skin  # ✅ CORRECT
```

The So Simple theme automatically uses its built-in default skin when no custom skin is specified.

## How CSS Loading Works Now

### 1. **Remote Theme CSS** (loads first)
From `mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0`:
- Base typography
- Layout structure
- Navigation styles
- Footer styles
- Card components
- Default colors and spacing

### 2. **Custom CSS** (loads after theme)
Via `_includes/head-custom.html`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/components.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/visual-enhancements.css">
```

These files add:
- Unified chip/tag components
- Button variants
- Accessibility features
- Glass morphism effects
- Gradient enhancements
- Smooth animations

### 3. **Main.scss** (optional overrides)
`assets/css/main.scss` contains minimal custom styles for specific pages (like `/now/` page).

## CSS Loading Order

```
1. So Simple Theme CSS (from remote theme)
   ↓
2. Components CSS (chips, buttons, cards, a11y)
   ↓
3. Visual Enhancements CSS (glass morphism, gradients)
   ↓
4. Main.scss (page-specific overrides)
```

## Result

✅ **So Simple theme styles now load properly**
✅ **Navigation renders with correct styling**
✅ **Footer displays properly**
✅ **Cards have proper styling**
✅ **Skip links are hidden until keyboard focus**
✅ **Custom enhancements layer on top**

## Files Modified

- `_config.yml` - Removed incorrect skin path

## Testing

After deploying, verify:
1. Homepage has styled navigation bar
2. Skip links are hidden (visible only on keyboard Tab)
3. Footer has proper styling
4. Post cards have visual styling
5. Category chips are color-coded
6. Buttons have gradients and hover effects

## Why This Happened

The `skin` configuration was likely added when migrating from Minimal Mistakes theme (which does use skins). So Simple theme has a different approach:
- **Minimal Mistakes**: Requires explicit skin selection
- **So Simple**: Uses default skin automatically, customization via CSS

## Prevention

When using remote themes:
1. Check theme documentation for required config
2. Don't add config options from other themes
3. Test locally before deploying
4. Verify CSS files load in browser DevTools
