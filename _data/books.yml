  - title: "Thinking in Systems"
    author: Donella Meadows
    started: Jan 2025
    summary: "Systems-thinking primer that helps me map finance, travel, and QA as living loops."
    notes: >-
      Why it fits: I keep returning to systemic framing, and this book lays out feedback loops, leverage points, and common system traps I can reuse everywhere.
      Highlights: Crisp writing, cross-domain case studies, and a direct echo of my Five Paradigms mental model.
  - title: "Fortune's Formula"
    author: William Poundstone
    started: Jan 2025
    summary: "A narrative history of the Kelly Criterion that tracks perfectly with my quant investing experiments."
    notes: >-
      Why it fits: I reference Kelly constantly, and this book explains how Claude Shannon and Ed Thorp ported information theory into portfolio sizing.
      Highlights: Blends math, casinos, and Wall Street with real stories that clarify path-dependent growth and convex strategies.
  - title: "The Most Important Thing"
    author: Howard Marks
    started: Jan 2025
    summary: "Risk philosophy from the cofounder of Oaktreeâ€”exactly what anchors the left side of my barbell playbook."
    notes: >-
      Why it fits: I'm obsessed with risk control over raw returns, and Marks pushes second-level thinking plus the behavioral structure behind permanent loss.
      Highlights: Short, focused chapters with applied insights that dovetail with Taleb's ideas and reinforce my "resilient + convex" thesis.
  - title: "Range"
    author: David Epstein
    started: Jan 2025
    summary: "A field guide for generalists that validates my habit of porting systems thinking across domains."
    notes: >-
      Why it fits: My path from QA to finance to travel and contemplative practice mirrors the book's case against the 10,000-hour myth.
      Highlights: Stories of athletes, scientists, and artists paired with the match vs. wicked environment lens that justifies broad exploration.
